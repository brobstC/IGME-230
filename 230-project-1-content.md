## Story
Tensions have been high in the city for years now, until one day where the resistance factions finally launch an assault on the leading government forces of the city. As an engineer at the nuclear power plant, you understand that any uncontrolled waste into the plant could cause severe trouble for not the city, but also the surrounding landscape. Therefore, in an attempt to protect the city from a nuclear explosion, you remain in the middle of war, tasked with preventing the residue of war tainting the nuclear power plant. In the middle of the crossfire, you stand determined to remove any hazardous material 
from the war enraging within your home.

## Esthetics
- 8-bit art and sound
- Ambient noises of war
- Audio indicators of new environmental hazards and power-ups

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
- Remove environmental hazards with differing power-ups
- Constant crossfire from the enraging war
- Hazard gauge must be kept under control
- Hazards cause differing debilitating effects to the player
- Score system based on time

### Controls
- Keyboard:
  - WASD: Movement
  - Spacebar: Use/Enabled Power-ups
  - CTRL: Cycle Power-ups
  - ESC: Pause
 - Mouse:
   - Aim Power-up Usage

### Teaching the game/New user experience
- Instructional screen with the control scheme and general objective of the game.

### Player Learning
The player needs to learn what power-ups to use to neutralize certain environmental hazards, ie water on fire, and what power-ups to avoid using on hazards that would cause additional hazards, ie fire on poison cloud. The player will also need be able to effectively avoid crossfire and environmental hazards while collecting power-ups in order to clear environmental hazards.
